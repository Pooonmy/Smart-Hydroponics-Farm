# Automated Control System for Hydroponic Farm

This project focuses on developing a smart hydroponic farming system based on the Deep Flow Technique, integrated with IoT technology to enhance precision and automation in plant cultivation. The system is designed to monitor and manage essential parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC) in the nutrient solution using advanced sensors. It features an automatic nutrient dispensing mechanism that ensures plants receive the optimal amount of nutrients, promoting healthy growth and maximizing yield.

A real-time dashboard allows users to monitor data from various sensors and control the system remotely via the internet, providing convenience and reducing the need for on-site management. The system is suitable for growing small plants like salads and Thai vegetables, making it ideal for commercial farming, home use, and community applications.

By utilizing resources efficiently and supporting sustainable practices, this project offers a scalable solution for modern agriculture, addressing the challenges of limited space, labor, and resource management while contributing to food security and technological advancement in agriculture.
